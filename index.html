                <p class="p top">Abdul Sattar Edhi was born on February 28, 1928, in Bantva, British India (now in
                    Gujarat, India). He migrated to Karachi after the partition of India in 1947. Edhi was deeply moved
                    by the state of healthcare and social welfare in the country and took it upon himself to bring about
                    change.

                    At the age of 20, he started working towards his vision of a just society. With little formal
                    education, Edhi learned from the struggles he witnessed and decided to dedicate his life to serving
                    humanity.

                    the world. The Foundation provides services such as:
